The \code{exprso} package includes these build modules:

- \code{\link{buildNB}}

- \code{\link{buildLDA}}

- \code{\link{buildSVM}}

- \code{\link{buildLM}}

- \code{\link{buildGLM}}

- \code{\link{buildLR}}

- \code{\link{buildLASSO}}

- \code{\link{buildANN}}

- \code{\link{buildDT}}

- \code{\link{buildRF}}

- \code{\link{buildFRB}}

- \code{\link{buildDNN}}
}
\details{
Build a binary classifier, multi-class classifier, or regression model.
 Like \code{\link{fs}} methods, \code{build} methods have a \code{top} argument
 which allows the user to specify which features to feed INTO the model
 build. This effectively provides the user with one last opportunity to subset
 the feature space based on prior feature selection or dimension reduction.
 For all build methods, \code{@preFilter} and \code{@reductionModel} will
 get passed along to the resultant \code{ExprsModel} object, again ensuring
 that any test or validation sets will undergo the same feature selection and
 dimension reduction in the appropriate steps when deploying the model.
 Set \code{top = 0} to pass all features through a \code{build} method.
