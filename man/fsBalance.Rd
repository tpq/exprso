\title{Convert Features into Balances}
\usage{
fsBalance(object, top = 0, sbp.how = "sbp.fromPBA", ternary = FALSE,
  ratios = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{ExprsArray} object to undergo feature selection.}

\item{top}{A numeric scalar or character vector. A numeric scalar indicates
the number of top features that should undergo feature selection. A character vector
indicates specifically which features by name should undergo feature selection.
Set \code{top = 0} to include all features. A numeric vector can also be used
to indicate specific features by location, similar to a character vector.}

\item{sbp.how}{A character string. The method used to build
the serial binary partition matrix of balances. Any
\code{balance::sbp.from*} function will work.}

\item{ternary}{A boolean. Toggles whether to return balances
representing three components. Argument passed to
\code{balance::sbp.subset}. Set \code{ternary = FALSE} and
\code{ratios = FALSE} to skip subset.}

\item{ratios}{A boolean. Toggles whether to return balances
representing two components. Argument passed to
\code{balance::sbp.subset}. Set \code{ternary = FALSE} and
\code{ratios = FALSE} to skip subset.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to the detailed function.}
}
\value{
Returns an \code{ExprsArray} object.
}
\description{
\code{fsBalance} converts features into balances.
 The balance rule is saved and deployed automatically by the
 \code{predict} method during test set validation.
