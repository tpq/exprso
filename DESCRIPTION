Description: Supervised machine learning has an increasingly important role in data
    analysis. This package introduces a framework for rapidly building and deploying
    supervised machine learning in a high-throughput manner. This package provides a
    user-friendly interface that empowers investigators to execute state-of-the-art
    binary and multi-class classification, as well as regression, with minimal
    programming experience necessary.
